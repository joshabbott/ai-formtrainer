Learn proper exercise form with pose estimation feedback and analysis. This is a prototype project to demonstrate how advances in pose estimation technologies (e.g., [Google's MediaPipe API](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe)) can help with learning proper exercise form. 

This repo will focus and help with the plank exercise in particular.
